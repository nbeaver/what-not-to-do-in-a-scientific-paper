- I will not write anything like "It is easy to see that..." or "obviously..." or "it follows trivially...".
  If the result is obvious, that will be apparent to the reader.
  If it is not, I will have alienated the reader without cause.
- I will not make a log-log plot of my data and then `conclude I have a power law`_ based on a least-squares linear fit. 
- I will not cite a result in another paper without quoting the relevant sentence or paragraph.
  I will do this to avoid ambiguity and provide context even when it may weaken my thesis.
- I will not cite an equation or figure in another paper without giving the figure/equation number and the page number it is on.
  This will provide valuable redundancy linking my work to the work I am building on and assist the reader.
- When I cite a prior result, I will cite the first paper or papers to report a result,
  not a more recent paper I happened to read which cites the original papers.
- If there is disagreement in the literature about a result,
  I will cite papers representative of the literature,
  not only the one which supports my thesis.
- I will not use `weasel`_ `words`_ like 'most', 'fairly', 'quite', or 'very'.
  They are warning signs of a lack of diligence or clarity.
- I will not use an acronym without defining it and displaying the definition prominently in a list of acronyms.
  This will save the people reading my article the wasted time and unnecessary frustration from hunting for definitions of acronyms buried in the text.
- When I cite calculations or numeric results from another paper,
  I will either cite them verbatim or show my calculations on the verbatim results.
  I will not perform calculations without showing the work, show the result, and then cite the other paper.
  This will prevent anyone reading my paper from having to guess how I calculated my result,
  and will make it apparent whether or not I made a mistake.
- When I use an equation from another paper,
  I will not silently change the notation.
  I will either use the original equation unaltered or quote the original equation in a footnote or endnote.
- When writing and revising papers, I will only discuss figures which are actually shown in my paper.
  If figures or tables are pushed into supplementary/supplemental/electronic-only/miscellaneous/supporting material,
  I will not refer to them in the published paper,
  but instead only discuss their implications in the supporting material.
