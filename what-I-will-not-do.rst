- I will not write anything like "It is easy to see that..." If it is easy to see, then it is unnecessary to say so. If it is not easy to see, I have needlessly irritated anyone reading the paper.
- I will not make a log-log plot of my data and then `conclude I have a power law`_ based on a least-squares linear fit. 
- I will not cite a figure in another paper without giving the page number and figure number, unless the result is in the abstract of the other paper.
- I will not cite a result in another paper without quoting the relevant sentence or paragraph. I will do this to avoid confusion and provide context even when it may weaken my thesis.
- When I cite a prior result, I will cite the first paper or papers to report a result, not a more recent paper I happened to read which cites the original papers.
- If there is disagreement in the literature about a result, I will cite papers representative of literature, not only the one which supports my thesis.
- I will not use `weasel`_ `words`_ like 'most', 'fairly', or 'very'. They are warning signs of a lack of diligence and clarity.
- I will not use an acronym without defining it and displaying the definition prominantly in a list of acronyms. This will save the people reading my article time and frustration hunting for definitions of acronyms buried in the text.
- When I cite calculations or numeric results from another paper, I will either cite them verbatim or show my calculations on the verbatim results. I will not perform calculations, show the result, and then cite the other paper. This will prevent anyone reading my paper from having to guess how I calculated my result and will make it apparent whether or not I made a mistake.
- When writing and revising papers, I will only discuss figures which are actually shown in my paper. If figures or tables are pushed into supporting material, I will not refer to them in the published paper, but instead discuss their implications in the supporting material.
